;Hey there,
Hola,


;Hey [firstname],
Hola [firstname],


;If you’re reading this, you’re one of the nearly 50% of people in the world on the internet. That also means 50% of the world’s population still <em>isn’t</em> online.
Si estás leyendo esto, eres parte del 50% de personas en el mundo que está en Internet. Eso también significa que el otro 50% de la población mundial todavía <em>no está</em> conectado.


;Surprised by that? Were you surprised that 50 million Facebook users had their data used by Cambridge Analytica for partisan political purposes without their knowledge?
¿Sorprendido? ¿Te sorprendió que Cambridge Analytica usara la información de más de 50 millones de usuarios de Facebook con fines políticos partidistas sin su conocimiento?

Mientras tanto, los zapatos pueden pedir pizza y la inteligencia artificial ayuda a los médicos a diagnosticar brotes de enfermedades más rápido que nunca. La salud de Internet no es sólo un problema técnico, es un problema <em>humano</em>.

;Through data, research and stories we show how the internet is evolving. What does ‘security’ mean in a world where our phones, watches, cars, and vacuums are all online? What is driving the onslaught of fake news? How big is ‘too big’ when it comes to tech giants?
