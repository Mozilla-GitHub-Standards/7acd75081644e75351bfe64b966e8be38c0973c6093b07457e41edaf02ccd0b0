## NOTE: Reference bug 1193997, deadline 10 September 2015.
## NOTE: These strings are used to generate tiles in New tab, e.g. https://bug1167339.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8628294
## NOTE: The static and roll-over text will be used to create images displayed in the tiles. The title is displayed under the tile.
## NOTE: Since the actual width will vary based on the characters used ("m" is larger than "l"), we set a lenght limit of a few characters.
## NOTE: Experimental view to check titles https://l10n.mozilla-community.org/~flod/tiles_demo/?file=tiles_sep2015.lang
## NOTE: (should autodetect your locale as soon as translations are available).
