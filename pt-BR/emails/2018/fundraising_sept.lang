;We’re in an urgent moment right now, where the issues we fight for are getting more and more attention every day. We’re uniquely positioned to make change — towards a healthier and more open internet, that respects the privacy and security of everyone that uses it. <strong>But we can’t do that without your support</strong>, so I hope you’ll chip in.

;From all of us here at Mozilla… THANKS!
De todos nós da Mozilla… OBRIGADO!


;Welcome back from summer! (Or winter, for those of you in the Southern Hemisphere.)
Bem-vindo(a) de volta do verão! (ou inverno, para aqueles do hemisfério sul)


;We’re looking back on a great year so far, challenging Facebook and Amazon over their data practices, getting insecure connected toys off retailers’ shelves and we have data protection laws with teeth coming into effect in more and more countries.

;But it’s not all rosy when it comes to the health of the internet — things have been getting crazier for a while now, and more people are noticing. You can’t open Twitter or a news site in the US without seeing another serious story on election hacking. And disinformation is just one of the issues we see growing in seriousness — both in reality and in the public mind.

;The issues Mozilla, our allies and our community have been talking about for almost two decades have become both urgent and broadly known.

;This is our moment to really step up and step in. <a>Glyn Moody recently wrote in the Linux Journal</a> that, “Mozilla is probably the only organization capable of doing this credibly. It urgently needs to broaden and deepen its already substantial advocacy activities yet further — for the common good, and its own relevance.” And, we’re working on that.

;We’ve been using the notion of “internet health” to bring people together and grapple with what’s going on right now, and what can be done. We’ve gathered a posse of fellows who are doing everything from helping our allies use tech to defend human rights to helping the US Senate Intelligence Committee understand underlying algorithmic and cybersecurity issues that fuel disinformation. As the public looks to the tech companies and starts to ask questions, we’ve given people a channel to actually ask these companies to make changes to their products. Almost every time we’ve done this, we’ve won.

;We will continue to stay the course: focusing on the issues of the day; finding more allies to collaborate with; and honing the programs we've built over the last few years.

;I’m so proud of the team, the programs and the community we’ve grown as we’ve done these things. You are a key part of this community. Together, we are showing up in a good way at the right time.
Estou muito orgulhoso da equipe, dos programas e da comunidade que construímos enquanto fazíamos essas coisas. Você é um ponto chave desta comunidade. Juntos, estamos aparecendo de maneira correta na hora certa.


;So, there you go. Times are crazy. The opportunity is big. We’re well teed up. Let’s keep it moving forward. Simple, right? :)
Então, vamos lá. Os tempos estão loucos. A oportunidade é grande. Estamos preparados. Vamos continuar avançando. Simples, certo? :)


;I’m looking forward to doing this, with all of you.
Estou ansioso em fazer isso, junto com todos vocês.


;Happy September…
Feliz setembro…
