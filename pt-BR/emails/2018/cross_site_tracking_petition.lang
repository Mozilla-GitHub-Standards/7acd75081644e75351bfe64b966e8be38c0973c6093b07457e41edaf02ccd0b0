;Congratulations! Facebook has changed their settings because of your actions. Now let’s keep the pressure on – can you ask Facebook to stop cross-site tracking too?

;Hey there,
Hey there,


;Dear [firstname],
Dear [firstname],


;Your Facebook settings look different this morning - that’s because more than 75,000 Mozilla supporters like you helped put the pressure on Facebook to clarify and communicate what data it was collecting on users friends via third party apps. Congratulations! Thank you so much – because you acted, we’re starting to see real change.

;It’s a great time to celebrate, thank Facebook for listening, and keep up the pressure while we have their attention.

;We have another big, important ask for Facebook as they work to limit the way they collect and use people’s data: <a>Stop tracking people by default as they browse throughout the web!</a>

;One of key data collection methods Facebook uses to track you is monitoring how you browse the web on other sites.

;You may not know it, but Facebook tracks how you browse the web through their “like” buttons on other websites, and they do this even if you don’t click them or have a Facebook account at all.

;If people want ads that are targeted to them, they should be able to turn these features on. Having cross-site tracking on by default isn’t okay, since many users may not have understood this kind of data collection was happening in the first place.
Se as pessoas quiserem anúncios direcionados para elas, elas deveriam poder habilitar estes recursos. Ter o rastreamento entre sites ligado por padrão não é bom, uma vez que muitos usuários podem não ter entendido que este tipo de coleta de dados estava ocorrendo em primeiro lugar.


;Will you add your name to tell Facebook to stop advertising using cross-site tracking by default?
Você vai adicionar o seu nome para dizer ao Facebook que pare de anunciar usando rastreamento entre sites por padrão?


;One thing that is clear from this week is that people want to know what type of data companies collect about them. Cross-site tracking often results in collection of people’s data without a lot of transparency.
Uma coisa que está clara a partir desta semana é que as pessoas querem saber que tipo de dados as companias coletam sobre elas. O rastreamento entre sites geralmente resulta na coleta de dados das pessoas sem muita transparência.


;This is a problem bigger than just Facebook - but if we can get Facebook to change, we think we can push other large platforms to make this change too.
Este é um problema maior que apenas o Facebook - mas se nós conseguimos levar o Facebook a mudar, nós pensamos que conseguimos levar outras grandes plataformas a também fazer esta mudança.


;Internet advocates have been calling for an end to cross-site tracking for some time because of the breadth of consumer surveillance it creates and how few consumers actually know that it’s happening.
Defensores da Internet têm pedido pelo fim do rastreamento entre sites há algum tempo devido à amplitude da vigilância do consumidor que ele cria e como poucos consumidores realmente sabem que isso está acontecendo.


;As Congress gears up for its upcoming hearings about Facebook, we have a great opportunity to highlight this issue and build on our winning momentum to get Facebook - and other online companies - to create this change and hopefully set off a wider industry discussion about transparency and user choice.
