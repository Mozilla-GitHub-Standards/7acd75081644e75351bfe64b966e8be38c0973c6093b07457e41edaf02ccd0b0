You, my friend, are a <s>very</s> good person.


;How do we know this? Because this is the 4th fundraising email we’ve sent in the past two months and here you are, taking a couple minutes of your day to read it. You could have clicked “delete”. Instead, here you are, still reading.

;And here we are, still asking for money. It’s often the worst part of working for a non-profit (the Mozilla Foundation is a non-profit btw, no shareholders or stock options here) — always asking others for money so we can do our do-gooder work.
E aqui estamos, ainda pedindo dinheiro. Muitas vezes é a pior parte do trabalho para uma organização sem fins lucrativos (a Fundação Mozilla é uma empresa sem fins lucrativos, sem acionistas ou opções de ações) - sempre pedindo dinheiro aos outros para que possamos fazer nosso trabalho bem feito.


;We fight to make life on the internet a little better. Some days we just try to keep life on the internet from getting any worse.
Lutamos para tornar a vida na internet um pouco melhor. Alguns dias, só tentamos evitar que a vida na Internet seja pior.
