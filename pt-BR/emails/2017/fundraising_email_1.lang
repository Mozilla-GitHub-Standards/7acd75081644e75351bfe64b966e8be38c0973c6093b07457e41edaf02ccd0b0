Hoje, eu vim pedir a você que doe para a Mozilla.


;I’m asking because it’s been a pretty rough year for many of us. There’s a lot of uncertainty in the world — and online — right now. I feel it. I’m guessing you feel it, too.
Estou pedindo isso porque foi um ano muito difícil para muitos de nós. Há muita incerteza no mundo — e on-line — hoje. Eu sinto isso. E acho que você também sente isso.


;I once heard someone say, “When you think you can’t take anymore, give.” Give to your neighbor, your friends, your family, that stranger on the street who looks like they could use a smile. Giving heals.

;Healthier means feeling more private and secure in your online life. Knowing what news is real and what is fake. Knowing that big corporations aren’t manipulating what you can access on the web. Building an Internet that belongs to all of us — and not just a few.
