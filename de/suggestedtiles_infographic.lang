How user data is protected on <b>Firefox New Tab</b>


;Suggested tiles are powered by a recommendation system that acts on behalf of the user, delivering relevance while respecting privacy. Here is basically how it works: We only send a limited amount of data back to our tiles selection server, Onyx, and store that raw data in our storage and analysis server, Disco, for a short period of time before aggregating it in our data warehouse. High-level aggregate reports are then shared with our partners.
